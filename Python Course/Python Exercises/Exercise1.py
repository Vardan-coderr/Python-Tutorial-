# calculator using python
 
# Example 1
# x = 16
# y = 5

# add = x+y
# print("The Addition of a and b is :",add)

# sub = x-y
# print("The Subtraction of a and b is :",sub)

# multiply = x*y
# print("The Multiplaication of a and b is :",multiply)

# Divide= x/y
# print("The Divison of a and b is :", Divide)

# Module = x%y
# print("The module of a and b is :",Module)

# Expoential = x**y
# print("The Expoential of a and b is :",Expoential)

# Example 2
# a = 10
# b = 3
# print("The value of", a ,"+",b,"is:", a+b)
# print("The value of", a ,"-",b,"is:", a-b)
# print("The value of", a ,"*",b,"is:", a*b)
# print("The value of", a ,"/",b,"is:", a//b)


# Example 3
# This is used when you want to take input from user
# print("This is program is for using calculator in python")

# num1 = int(input("The value of a  is :"))
# num2 = int(input("The value of b  is :"))
# add = num1+num2
# sub = num1-num2
# multiply = num1*num2
# divide = num1/num2
# module = num1%num2
# expoential = num1**num2
# print("The Addition of a and b is :",add)
# print("The Subtraction of a and b is :",sub)
# print("The Multiplication of a and b is :",multiply)
# print("The Divison of a and b is :",divide)
