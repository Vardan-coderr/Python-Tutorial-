# In these Tutorail we learn about Taking input from user in python
# In python we can take input from user by using input() function
# The input() function takes input from the user and returns it as a string

# a = input("Enter your name :")
# print("My Name is :",a)
# b = input("Enter Your Class :")
# print("My Class is :", b)

# x = input("Enter First Your Number :")
# y = input("Enter Second Your Number :")
# sum = x + y # here x and y are string so the + operator will concatenate the two strings
# print("The Sum Of Two Number is :",sum)
# print(type(sum))

num1 = input("Enter First Your Number :")
num2 = input("Enter Second Your Number :")
# You also take input from user int type directly by using int() function
# num1 = int(input("Enter First Your Number :"))
# num2 = int(input("Enter Second Your Number :"))
add = int(num1) + int(num2)
print("The sum of two number is :",add)
print(type(add))

# Now we make a program to calculate number and take input from user

# num1 = int(input("The value of a  is :"))
# num2 = int(input("The value of b  is :"))
# add = num1+num2
# sub = num1-num2
# multiply = num1*num2
# divide = num1/num2
# print("The Addition of a and b is :",add)
# print("The Subtraction of a and b is :",sub)
# print("The Multiplication of a and b is :",multiply)
# print("The Divison of a and b is :",divide)
